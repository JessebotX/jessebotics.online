# jessebotics.online

My personal static website made with Next.js, React,
TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

It can be viewed at <https://jessebotics.online>.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with
your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying
`pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the
file.

## Building Website

Run the following command
```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm run build
# or 
yarn build
```

and it should build a static website in the `out/` folder.
Use `rsync` to upload the website to the remote server.
